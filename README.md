# ðŸš€ FastAPI Project Template (Cookiecutter)

---

This repository provides a robust and opinionated Cookiecutter template for quickly bootstrapping new FastAPI projects. It aims to set up a clean, scalable, and well-structured foundation with modern Python development best practices, including asynchronous capabilities, database integration, and pre-configured tools for linting, formatting, and testing using `uv` and `ruff`.
